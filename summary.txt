I’m Arth Darji, currently in the final year of my degree. I have a strong interest in creative and active hobbies—I enjoy playing the guitar, dancing, and swimming, which help me stay both expressive and fit. On weekends, I like to relax by café hopping and spending quality time exploring new places. These interests reflect my balanced lifestyle, where I focus on both personal growth and enjoying life outside academics.
